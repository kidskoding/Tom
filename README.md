# Tom
To combat the excessive teacher shortage conflict in the United States, I created Tom, a combination of a voice assistant AI and a website that I created using Volt.js, Python Flask, and Docker. Tom has been leveraged to reduce the burden teachers from grades K-12 face on a daily basis.
<br />
<br />
Tom can conceptually be broken down into three parts: <b>eGrading</b>, <b>eTutoring</b>, and <b>eClassroom</b>.

To run the website, please run the "run.py" file

To run the voice assistant, please run the "tom.py" file

Fun Fact: I named my voice assistant Tom because it is the first three letters of my district name Tomball. Tom won the third-place award/trophy at the district-level science fair event and advanced to the Houston level!
